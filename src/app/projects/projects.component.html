            <p>In this project, I have created my own <a href="#">PERSONAL WEBSITE</a> to showcase my ability to create
              website interfaces where the site contains my personal information and the services I can do
              Where the site is divided into several sections with some animation to make it look better.</p>

                MANAGEMENT</a> app using IoT approach .
              where we had to find a way to reduce waiting time for emergency vehicles on the road.
              And after research and several studies we found a way to reduce waiting time by calculating the percentage
              of congestion in all neighboring roads. and this allowed us to predict the waiting time
              and choose the correct road.and we could to found a solution minimized the waiting time for emergency
              vehicles.</p>
